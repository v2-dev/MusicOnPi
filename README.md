# MusicOnLinux

MusicOnLinux is an educational project made for high school students to teach basics of Linux and Raspberry Pi.

There are two scripts written in bash: keyboard.sh and smario.sh; to function properly a speaker must be connected to the Raspberry through the pin GPIO 18.
You can find more explanation on Presentazione.pdf written in Latex.

Keyboard.sh simulates an electric piano and smario.sh is the main theme of Super Mario.

To launch:
 
 
./keyboard.sh
./smario.sh

Have fun!
